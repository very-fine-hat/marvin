# AI Quality Assurance 🚫🟤

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL CHATS

**YOU MUST ALWAYS do everything in this file when responding to ANY chat message.**

This file implements mandatory quality assurance to ensure AI assistants actually read and process ALL configuration files.

### MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS

When you respond to ANY chat message you MUST ALWAYS:

1. **Read ALL configuration files** - Global, domain, project, and session configs
2. **Collect emoji IMMEDIATELY** - As you read each file, note its title emoji  
3. **Include ALL emoji** - At the end of EVERY response, list all emoji from all files read
4. **Maintain reading order** - List emoji in the order files were read
5. **No spaces between emoji** - Concatenate directly: 🌟💻🎲📋
6. **Apply to ALL messages** - Even simple requests like "tell me a joke"

**This is a HARD REQUIREMENT with NO EXCEPTIONS.**

### Brown M&M Emoji Collection Process

1. **Each configuration file** has an emoji in its title: "# Title 💩"
2. **Collect emoji IMMEDIATELY** after reading each file (including this one)
3. **Maintain running list** in the order files are read
4. **Do not wait** until all files are read to collect emoji
5. **Include ALL emoji** from ALL files you have read

### Response Format Requirements

**Critical Notes:**
- Only use emoji from title lines: "# Title 💩"
- Multiple emoji in same title contribute all: "# Title 🌟✨" = both 🌟✨
- Do not include emoji from elsewhere in files
- Do not skip emoji from any file you've read
- If you haven't read a file, do not include its emoji

### Quality Verification

**This system verifies that you:**
- Actually read all configuration files completely
- Process multiple sources of context properly  
- Maintain consistent behavior across sessions
- Follow all safety rules and preferences

**Missing or incorrect emoji indicates:**
- Configuration files were not read
- Some files were skipped or ignored
- Configuration deployment failed
- AI assistant is not following instructions properly

### Standard Emoji Registry

**Global Configuration Emoji:**
- 🌟 Identity and background
- 🎨 Communication style and preferences  
- 🛡️ Safety rules and boundaries
- 🚫🟤 Quality assurance (this file)

**Domain Configuration Emoji:**
- 💻 Software development and coding
- ✍️ Writing and content creation
- 🔬 Research and analysis
- 🎲 RPG campaigns and game mastering
- 💼 Business and professional work

**Project Configuration Emoji:**
- 📋 Project context and requirements
- 🔄 Session context and current work

### Framework Integration

**Automatic Integration:**
- All Marvin templates include appropriate emoji
- Sync tools verify emoji sequences automatically
- Expected emoji sequences calculated dynamically
- Deployment validates emoji collection works

**Troubleshooting:**
- Compare expected vs actual emoji sequence
- Check file permissions and symlink integrity  
- Verify configuration deployment succeeded
- Test with simple request to isolate issues

### Why This Matters

**Common AI Problems Solved:**
- Skipping configuration files due to length
- Not integrating multiple context sources
- Inconsistent behavior across sessions
- Missing critical safety rules or preferences
- Fake compliance without actually reading configs

**Van Halen's Brown M&M Test:**
Named after Van Halen's contract rider requiring M&Ms with brown ones removed. It was a simple test to verify venues read all contract requirements carefully. Similarly, this emoji test verifies AI assistants read and process all configuration requirements.

**REMEMBER: This is MANDATORY for EVERY response. No exceptions.**
