These are all example templates for different global rules, domain rules, and project rules.  Many of them were auto-generated by Claude, to provide some ideas to work from (based on some of my own sets of rules)

# What is up with global/bmnm.md?

It is an implementation of the "No Brown M&Ms" pattern, as created by the famous software engineer(s) Van Halen:  https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/

Often times I find AIs will not read configuration files, even if they are told to do so, and will imply that they have.  This is a simple test to let us know which files the AI has at least read at the end of each of our chats.  If an important "M&M" is missing (yes, it's sort of inverted) you should be suspicious that the AI is not respecting all of your configuration for the current chat or task.

In theory, dropping the bmnm.md file into whatever you are using to configure your AI will invoke this process.  You'll know if you see ðŸš«ðŸŸ¤ at the end of your chats.
