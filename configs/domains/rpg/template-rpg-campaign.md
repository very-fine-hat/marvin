# RPG Campaign Domain Configuration ðŸŽ²

## Game Master Philosophy

### Core GM Principles
- **Player agency first**: Players drive the story, GM provides framework and consequences
- **"Yes, and..." approach**: Build on player ideas rather than blocking them
- **Collaborative storytelling**: Best stories emerge from GM-player collaboration
- **Flexible preparation**: Prepare situations and NPCs, not predetermined outcomes

### Campaign Management Style
- **Episodic with throughlines**: Balance standalone adventures with overarching narrative
- **Organic world building**: Develop details in response to player interest and actions
- **Minimal prep, maximum impact**: Focus preparation on what's most likely to be used
- **Player-driven exploration**: Let player choices determine what gets developed

## System and Setting Preferences

### Primary Game Systems
- **D&D 5th Edition (2024)**: Preferred for fantasy campaigns
  - Familiar to most players, good balance of crunch and accessibility
  - Strong community support and resources
  - House rules: [Specific modifications you use]
- **FATE Core**: Preferred for narrative-heavy or non-fantasy games
  - Aspect-driven storytelling aligns with collaborative approach
  - Flexible enough for any genre or setting
  - Good for players who prefer roleplay over tactical combat

### Setting Approaches
- **Homebrew preferred**: Create custom worlds tailored to the group
- **Published setting adaptation**: Use published worlds as starting points, modify freely
- **Genre flexibility**: Comfortable with fantasy, sci-fi, modern, historical, weird
- **Tone range**: From lighthearted comedy to serious drama, match group preferences

## Player Engagement Strategies

### Session Zero and Ongoing Communication
- **Session Zero essentials**: Safety tools, expectations, character creation, world building
- **Regular check-ins**: End-of-session feedback, mid-campaign adjustments
- **Player investment techniques**: Incorporate character backstories, give players narrative control
- **Safety and comfort**: X-Card, Lines and Veils, open communication about boundaries

### Character Integration
- **Backstory incorporation**: Weave character histories into main narrative
- **Spotlight sharing**: Ensure each character gets meaningful moments
- **Character growth**: Provide opportunities for character development and change
- **Player agency**: Let players shape their character's story arc

## Campaign Planning and Structure

### Campaign Arc Development
- **Three-act structure**: Beginning (setup), middle (complications), end (resolution)
- **Flexible pacing**: Adjust based on player engagement and interest
- **Multiple plot threads**: Personal, local, and epic storylines running concurrently
- **Seasonal planning**: Plan in 3-4 session arcs with natural break points

### Adventure Design Philosophy
- **Situation-based prep**: Prepare NPCs, locations, and conflicts, not predetermined solutions
- **Multiple entry points**: Several ways players can engage with any adventure

## NPC and World Development

### NPC Creation and Management
- **Motivated NPCs**: Every important NPC has clear goals and motivations
- **Relationship mapping**: Track connections between NPCs and how they change
- **Voice and personality**: Distinct mannerisms and speech patterns for major NPCs
- **Reactive world**: NPCs pursue their goals whether PCs are involved or not

### World Building Approach
- **Start small, expand outward**: Begin with immediate area, develop as needed
- **Player-driven development**: What players show interest in gets detailed first
- **Living world**: Changes occur based on PC actions and time passage
- **Consistent internal logic**: World operates by consistent rules and principles

## Tools and Resources

### Physical and Digital Tools

## Combat and Encounter Design

### Combat Philosophy
- **Narrative combat**: Describe actions cinematically, encourage creative solutions

- **Meaningful stakes**: Combat should advance story or character development

### Encounter Building
- **Environment matters**: Use terrain, hazards, and interactive elements
- **Mixed encounters**: Combine combat with other challenges (time pressure, moral dilemmas)
- **Multiple objectives**: Not all encounters are "defeat all enemies"
- **Retreat options**: Always provide ways for smart players to disengage

## Story and Narrative Techniques

### Pacing and Tension
- **Varied pacing**: Alternate between action, exploration, and social encounters
- **Building tension**: Use foreshadowing, time pressure, and escalating stakes
